issue #34 fully works here
issue #35 is hand coded into #34

do a merge request for #35
(#35 has to be canceled and a newly worded issue has to be opened)
do a separate merge request for #34 after merging in #35
this will keep it clean on the maintainer end

Usage in docs still talk about IDF. It is now EPJ.
needs to be updated
(does it really need to be epj)

EPJ.__repr__ is printing human readable format
EPJ.__str__ should do that not `.__repr__`

I need the __repr__ to work correctly now !!!! :-(
open a new issue on this ... so that I can focus on it.

Maybe solution to eppy vs eppy3000 issue:
- original thought was
    - develop eppy3000 as a natural flow
    - develop eppy independently with eppy300 functionality
- new possibility
     - import eppy into eppy300
     - have connection between eppy3000 data-structure and eppy data-structure
         - so when one changes, the other changes

If ipython is running the wrong version of python, then:

Run hash -r
From your bash shell, run::

    hash -r

And try running iPython again.

When you've run iPython previously in a shell session, that command was cached. This command simply resets the cache. And now when you run::

    ipython

it will refer to the version of iPython that you installed in your virtual environment.
